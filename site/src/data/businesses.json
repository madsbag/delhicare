Dr Sakshi and Dr Syed were really great to tone me up and there after, the gait and walking have really improved beyond my expectations. The supervised exercises under their vigilant and expert care, coupled with the relaxing atmosphere was instrumental in getting me back on my feet. Also, Dr. Soumyesh N Bhaduri was an asset with his great wisdom and experience. He was quick to identify the mistakes I was making with my posture and walking and instructed the team to correct them. They have also offered to do a tele consultation to track my home exercise regimen.
